# Model View Controller

Embedded into the Home View Controller, Model View Controller is the key to present OpenGL content. It is a layer between application behavior and OpenGL functions as it is a subclass of GLKViewController.

## OverView

We can see and interact with Model View Controller through Home View Controller since the Model View Controller is added to the Home View Controller, and the main view, which is the avatar, in Home View Controller belongs to the Model View Controller.

Since this controller is a lower layer controller, there is no obvious user interaction events, so we will discuss it in term of methods it contains. In order to have a context of what will be discussed below, it is recommended to have a knowledge of GLKViewController and OpenGL basics.
