# Image Preview View Controller

In this controller, user can preview those taken photos to decide whether to create an avatar with those taken photos or to retake photos if he does not like any photo been taken. Once user decide to create an avatar with these photos, if he does not take face photo, the screen will segue directly to `CreatingAvatarController` , if he does take face photo then the screen will segue to `HairEyeSelectController` to select more detail for the avatar.
